# Internet tips

Use an antivirus.

Use safe passwords (at least 8 characters, a number, and a special character).

Be wary of websites that start with "http://" instead of "https://". The S stands for "secure".

Don't download files from untrusted websites.

If you're unsure whether a website or file is safe, scan it using VirusTotal (check websites [here](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/home/url) and files [here](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/home/upload).
